    Number used as logic:                      667 out of   9,112    7%
      Number using O6 output only:             546
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                  121
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   206 out of   2,278    9%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   4,556    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          667
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           426 out of     667   63%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     667    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         241 out of     667   36%
    Number of unique control sets:               9
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              33 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
